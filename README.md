Welcome to My Cyber Workbench: @grey-soul's Digital Journey

Hey there! I'm @grey-soul, a Software Engineering Student and a dedicated Cybersecurity Enthusiast. My journey is all about diving deep into the tech world, constantly learning, and sharing what I discover.

My Current Focus & Expanding Skills

Right now, I'm heavily focused on Cybersecurity, specifically expanding my hands-on skills in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. It's about understanding how systems break so we can build them stronger.

My Toolkit & Areas of Interest

Here's a look at the technologies and domains I'm actively working with and researching:



Cybersecurity Research: Always digging into the latest threats, defenses, and trends.

Python (Programming Language): My go-to for scripting, automation, and cybersecurity tooling.

Web Application Penetration Testing: Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web apps.

Penetration Testing: Broader scope, looking at networks, systems, and more.

Future Horizons

Looking ahead, I'm really keen to explore AI and Machine Learning (ML). The potential for these fields to transform cybersecurity is immense, and I plan to make them a significant part of my future learning.

Let's Connect

I'm always open to collaborating, sharing knowledge, or discussing new ideas. If you're working on projects in cybersecurity, AI/ML applications, or innovative tech solutions for startups, hit me up!

I'll be adding direct contact info here soon.
